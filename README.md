This is a project from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms?ref=lnav

It is a prototype flight booker web app, without the billing/payment step.

The user can search for one-way flights and select one, then enter passenger information to book the flight.
